This project had been developed during my Master Degree in "Data Science and Business Informatics" at the University of Pisa for the "Text Analytics" course.

This project analyse a dataset containing several tweets from Twitter and it tries to classify them according to "toxic" or "non-toxic". When a tweet is considered to be toxic, it is then analyze using topic modeling in order to find the specific area of toxicity (sexism, cyberbullism, racism, etc).
